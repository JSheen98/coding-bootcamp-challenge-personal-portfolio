# Challenge 2: Advanced CSS Professional Porfolio


## Description

With this website, I wanted to show off my growing developer's portfolio. My goal is to give future employers a good idea of the skillset I currently have, and the detail I've put into the work I've done so far. Part of this goal, was to create a clean, organized, styled professional portfolio website that encases and compliments my work well. It has color and it has some different features, but it doesn't have too much going on, and it should give the viewer a sense of organization and professionalism.

## User Story

* AS AN employer

* I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples

* SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candiate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work

* WHEN I load their portfolio

* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation

* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work

* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application

* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* WHEN I click on the images of the applications

* THEN I am taken to that deployed application

* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices

* THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
